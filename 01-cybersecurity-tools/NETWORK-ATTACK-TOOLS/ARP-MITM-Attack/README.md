# 🔍 Live Host Multi-Port Scanner (CIDR + Ping + Threads)

A beginner-friendly, high-speed port scanner that takes a CIDR IP range, checks which hosts are **live** using `ping`, and scans multiple common ports in parallel using Python’s `threading` and `socket` modules. A clean and efficient tool for internal network assessments.
