# 🛡️ Phishing Detector (AI + ML)

This project is a **Phishing Website Detection Tool** powered by **Machine Learning** and AI.  
It detects whether a given URL/website is **legitimate** or **phishing** using a trained model.

## 📂 Project Files

- `phish_detector.pkl` → Trained ML model for phishing detection  
- `phish_history.txt` → Log/history file for predictions  
- `phishing_detector.py` → Main script to run phishing detection  
- `phishingai.py` → AI/ML logic and model handling  
- `tempCodeRunnerFile.py` → Temporary test script (auto-generated by editor)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone this repository
git clone <your-repo-link>  
cd <repo-folder>  

### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Then install required packages:  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

(*If you don’t have `requirements.txt`, install the common libraries manually: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, joblib.*)

### 3. Run the detector
python phishing_detector.py

## 🛠️ File Path Reference

> ⚠️ Replace blank paths below with the actual locations if needed.

- Model file path → `     /phish_detector.pkl`  
- History file path → `     /phish_history.txt`  
- Detector script path → `     /phishing_detector.py`  
- AI logic path → `     /phishingai.py`  
- Temp runner file → `     /tempCodeRunnerFile.py`  

---

## 📒 Example Usage

Run the following in terminal:  
python phishing_detector.py  

Then enter a **URL** when prompted. The program will return:  
- ✅ Legitimate  
- ❌ Phishing  

The result is also stored in `phish_history.txt`.

---

## 🧠 How it Works
1. Extracts features from a URL (length, domain, HTTPS usage, etc.).  
2. Passes the features to the **trained ML model** (`phish_detector.pkl`).  
3. Predicts whether the site is phishing or safe.  
4. Saves the result into a history file.  

---

## 📌 Notes
- Works offline with the trained `.pkl` model.  
- For best accuracy, retrain the model with updated phishing datasets.  
- Logs are saved automatically in `phish_history.txt`.
