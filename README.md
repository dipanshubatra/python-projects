## 💻 How to Run Projects

> ✅ Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system  
> 🪟 Some projects (like slots) use `winsound` – run them on **Windows OS** for full audio features

```bash
# Navigate into a project folder
cd 02-daily-utility-apps/shopping-cart
# or
cd 01-cybersecurity-tools/text-cipher-encoder
# or
cd 04-ai-ml-tools/disease-prediction

# Run the script
python shopping_cart.py
python text_cipher_encoder.py
python predict.py
