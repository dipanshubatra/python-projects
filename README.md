> 🪟 Some projects (like slots) use `winsound` – run them on **Windows OS** for full audio features

```bash
# Navigate into a project folder
cd 02-daily-utility-apps/shopping-cart
# or
cd 01-cybersecurity-tools/text-cipher-encoder

# Then run the script
python shopping_cart.py
# or
python text_cipher_encoder.py
